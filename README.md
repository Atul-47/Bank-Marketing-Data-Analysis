Logistic Regression on the “Bank Marketing” UCI dataset

[1]. Create a parametric model using Logistic Regression (with linear as well as
polynomial features)

[2]. Compare its accuracy/precision/recall etc. with a non-parametric model built
using SVM

[3]. Perform PCA and find the number of dimensions required to capture 80% of
variance. Assess the performance improvement.
